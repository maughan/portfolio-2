      <h3 className='title'>About me</h3>
      <p>I am a software developer with a passion for creative thinking and problem solving. My interest for programming began from a dare to learn coding only to find myself months later taking a Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly.<br />
        I pride myself in adaptability and precision in my work that I have carried across from my previous profession as a hairstylist in the fashion industry. Fast forward to now, I am looking to grow as a junior developer and apply my skills into an innovative and creative work environment.
